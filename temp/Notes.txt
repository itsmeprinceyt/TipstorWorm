to-do
add uploaded by string in mongo db & add time as well


so you just add a condition that if you click on a existing data and it has already id of that data then go into edit mode
so when in edit mode u need to parse that id and get data from mongodb and replace all those data in the field
if that data exist using ternary operator and then upon sending post request u need to add if else that if sending editmode on post request then u need to send with id and parameters while if sending to add new data then u just simply send to /api/Tipstor route which will add that file new 

u need only 1 [id] and in that just define PUT,GET,DELETE, whatever. and when sending api-request then u need to specify that particular PUT,GET,DELETE so it hit what it needs to hit.
